Wordle variant where every row contains exactly one clue of incorrect colour

A simple GUI for playing Wordle, except every row contains exactly one clue of incorrect colour.
The cultural reference is pretty bad, BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE :-)

I have deliberately left some low-hanging fruit for others (probably beginners) to practice contributing to someone else's project. For example

(i) The word list is from https://7esl.com/5-letter-words/ but I should use a much larger dictionary

(ii) The user should not be able to enter words not in the dictionary e.g. "SDFSD"

(iii) Make the graphics more aethetically pleasing

(iv) Add configuration parameters (e.g. the number of guesses)

(v) I won't be surprised if you can think of others :-)
